Built classification models to predict cancer risk using structured clinical feature data.
Implemented Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest classifiers.
Evaluated baseline and tuned models using Accuracy and ROC-AUC metrics.
Achieved strong class separation with tuned SVM (Accuracy ≈ 0.97, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.96).
Analyzed performance trade-offs to select stable, generalizable risk predictors.
